🌟 Task 1: Build Infrastructure with Terraform
Welcome to Task 1: Build Infrastructure! 🚀 In this guide, you'll learn how to create basic infrastructure using Terraform. By the end of this task, you'll have successfully provisioned a VPC network on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 🎉

📖 Overview
Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision cloud resources in a declarative configuration language. 🛠️

In this task, we will:

Write a Terraform configuration file (main.tf) to create a VPC network.
Initialize Terraform to download necessary plugins.
Apply the configuration to deploy the infrastructure.
🛠️ Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following:

✅ A GCP project set up.
✅ Terraform installed on your system (pre-installed in Cloud Shell).
✅ Access to Cloud Shell in the Google Cloud Console.
⚙️ Configuration Steps
1️⃣ Create a Terraform Configuration File
Open Cloud Shell in your GCP console.
Create an empty configuration file named main.tf:
touch main.tf
Open the file in the editor:
Click Open Editor in the Cloud Shell toolbar.
Navigate to main.tf and add the following content:
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "3.5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "google" {
  project = "PROJECT_ID"
  region  = "REGION"
  zone    = "ZONE"
}

resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
  name = "terraform-network"
}
💡 Tip: Replace PROJECT_ID, REGION, and ZONE with your GCP project details.

2️⃣ Verify the Configuration File
Run the following command to list all .tf files in your directory:

ls
Ensure only main.tf exists in the directory.

🚦 Execution
1️⃣ Initialize Terraform
Run the following command to initialize Terraform:

terraform init
This will:

Download the required provider plugin (e.g., hashicorp/google).
Set up local settings and data for Terraform.
🔍 Output Example:

Initializing provider plugins...
Installing hashicorp/google v3.5.0...
2️⃣ Apply the Configuration
Apply the configuration to create the VPC network:

terraform apply
Review the Execution Plan output.
Type yes when prompted to confirm.
⏳ Note: It may take a few minutes for the VPC network to be created.

📜 Verifying Your Work
1️⃣ Check the VPC Network
Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Navigate to VPC Network from the Navigation menu.
Verify that the terraform-network appears in the list.
2️⃣ Inspect the Terraform State
Terraform stores the state of your infrastructure in a file called terraform.tfstate. To inspect the current state, run:

terraform show
🔍 Example Output:

# google_compute_network.vpc_network:
resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
  name                 = "terraform-network"
  id                   = "terraform-network"
  ...
}
💡 Additional Notes
The terraform.tfstate file is critical for tracking the resources managed by Terraform. Do not delete or modify it manually.
To destroy the infrastructure, use:
terraform destroy
🎉 Congratulations! You've successfully built your first infrastructure with Terraform. 🚀 Keep exploring and building more complex configurations!
